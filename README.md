# Calculator

Please write a command line utility that functions as a basic calculator over
standard input and standard output. You may limit the supported operations to
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Parentheses
should be supported, as should the constants Ï€ and e (Eulerâ€™s number). Print the
result if the expression is valid and nothing otherwise. The exit code of the
program should be 0 if the expression is valid and 1 otherwise.

## CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into
production - then push your changes to the main branch.

Have fun coding! ðŸš€

## Background

At RISC Zero, we believe that technical screens should be optimized for
real-world coding skills and candidate pool inclusivity. We believe that a
take-home coding exercise is the best way to do that.

## Effort

We recognize that candidates are often applying for multiple positions, so we
try to keep our exercises from being too onerous. Itâ€™s impossible for us to keep
all exercises the exact same difficulty, but candidates should expect to put two
to four hours into a project. Depending on the exercise, the weighting of this
time between research and coding may differ.

## Grading

We put a lot of effort into making sure that submissions are graded
consistently. Though we typically canâ€™t provide detailed feedback, weâ€™re looking
for code that is functional, usable, efficient, maintainable, and secure. Beyond
that, weâ€™re looking for a demonstration of skills that apply to the specific
role that youâ€™re applying to. We donâ€™t expect submissions to be flawless - real
world coding requires compromises, and so should your submission. As part of
final interviews, we ask candidates to talk more deeply about their take-home
submission - this is a great time to talk about where you had to compromise.

## Questions

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your contact at RISC Zero.
Though this is expected to be mostly a solo exercise, it is possible that there
are ambiguities or issues with prompts. If there are, weâ€™d like to know about
them both to make your experience better and to improve the experience for
future candidates.
